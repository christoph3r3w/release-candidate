Within Deloitte Netherlands, a team called the Digital Factory works on optimizing internal processes and applications to help employees save time and enjoy their day better. Within this team, we work with a mix of nerds and creatives in order to rapidly prototype cool things. We work from discovery with service designers to creatives for UI / UX to deliver an app by our nerds. App here is the broad sense of the word, meaning native or web application.


## Digital Factory
Your task will be to create an interactive prototype. We'll provide you with our styleguide and a set of data to start with. You'll be using a Directus instance to apply that data in your prototype. Our focus lies on a prototype that can be tested with real employees, it therefor doesn't have to fully work in all browsers (we're all working on company laptops with the latest version of Safari and Chrome), but it has to look good. We're a huge fan of providing transitions and animations in our application to give our employees a "nice" moment.

You'll be working on a way to choose the right mobility program when you're working at Deloitte. Our colleagues currently have to read through a lot of unstructured information to determine which form of transport suits best to their needs. You can read through some of the options [here](https://werkenbijdeloitte.nl/over-deloitte/arbeidsvoorwaarden/travel-expenses-2).

In the end, we're expecting an application that a user can open, log in to, click through and by selecting various options or entering their own preferences will result in an advice for the option to choose. More information will be shared with you when you visit us at one of our offices.


## Design challenge
_How can we build a modern, interactive prototype for the Digital Factory, that can be expaneded upon into a real application, that helps users choose which type of mobility is right for them if they work at Deloitte, based on their job, role and requirements?_
