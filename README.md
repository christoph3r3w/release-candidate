Within Deloitte Netherlands, a team called the Digital Factory works on optimizing internal process and applications to help employees save time and enjoy their day better. Within this team, we work with a mix of nerds and creatives in order to rapidly prototype cool things. We work from discovery with service designers to creatives for UI / UX to deliver an app by our nerds. App here is the broad sense of the word, meaning native or web application.
